Some of the most widely used include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>TinyMCE</strong>: A versatile and customizable editor that integrates well with various content management systems.</li>\n<li><strong>CKEditor</strong>: Known for its robust feature set and ease of integration.</li>\n<li><strong>Froala</strong>: Offers a clean and modern interface with a focus on performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Figma to code with builder.io</h2>\n<p>For those looking to bridge the gap between design and development, tools like Builder.io offer a compelling solution.
