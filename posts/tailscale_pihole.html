<p>I had a few issues with lighttpd not having the <code>lighttpd-mod-openssl</code> package installed.</p>
<p>But after a bit of jiggery pokery with the certificates, everything worked smoothly.</p>
<p>I enabled <code>tailscale cert</code> on my raspberrypi (which requires https &#x26; magic DNS).</p>
<p>I think tailscale now takes priority as first DNS nameserver, and then refers to the pihole as configured in the management dashboard.</p>
<p>so anyway pihole with https over my tailnet! woo.</p>
<p>I am a little concerned about this page: <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1153/enabling-https#view-certificate-status">configure https tailscale.com</a></p>
<p>It mentions that I should acknowledge that my machine names and tailnet will be published on a public ledger, so I guess that's fine but just more attack surface for my stuff!</p>
<p>The other downside is that I can only give the cert for a specific domain, rather than have some subject alternative names included in the certificate. but this is fine.</p></div></article></main><div class="layout_backToHome__D9QFr"><a href="/durosyan">‚Üê Back to home</a></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"tailscale_pihole","contentHtml":"\u003cp\u003eI added SSL to my pihole today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a few issues with lighttpd not having the \u003ccode\u003elighttpd-mod-openssl\u003c/code\u003e package installed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut after a bit of jiggery pokery with the certificates, everything worked smoothly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI enabled \u003ccode\u003etailscale cert\u003c/code\u003e on my raspberrypi (which requires https \u0026#x26; magic DNS).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think tailscale now takes priority as first DNS nameserver, and then refers to the pihole as configured in the management dashboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eso anyway pihole with https over my tailnet! woo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am a little concerned about this page: \u003ca href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1153/enabling-https#view-certificate-status\"\u003econfigure https tailscale.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt mentions that I should acknowledge that my machine names and tailnet will be published on a public ledger, so I guess that's fine but just more attack surface for my stuff!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other downside is that I can only give the cert for a specific domain, rather than have some subject alternative names included in the certificate. but this is fine.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"TailScale PiHole and OpenSSL","date":"2025-01-15","tags":"tinkering, privacy, engineering"}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[id]","query":{"id":"tailscale_pihole"},"buildId":"uZAnH4RiZeTKWOuPga4hs","assetPrefix":"/durosyan","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
