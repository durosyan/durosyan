This is my github pages repository. It's full of notes and things that I do.

I'm a passionate IT professional with experience in software engineering and cybersecurity.

My goal is to become a cybersecurity professional, and I'm currently studying for my CompTIA Security+ certification.

In my spare time, I enjoy bouldering, hiking, and volunteering with the [British Mountaineering Council](https://www.thebmc.co.uk/en/get-involved-volunteering).

The purpose of this blog is to:

1. Document my learning journey
2. Share my experiences
3. Help others
